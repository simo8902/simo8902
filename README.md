# Hi, I'm Simeon Mladenov and 24 sad years old! 👋

I am currently learning the hell out of the C++ language

- ASM
- LUA most likely
- HLSL (not in this life)

## 🚀 Projects

- [Game Engine](https://github.com/simo8902/idk) - An simple game engine built with C++ and OpenGL

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- C++, OpenGL, IMGui

- Game Development, Engine Architecture, User Interface, Reverse Engineering
- Html, PHP, CSS, C#, C, Python, Basic, Lua 
- Unity, Unreal, Game Maker 2 and many more that I forgot
